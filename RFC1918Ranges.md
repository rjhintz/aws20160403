## Private IP Address ranges, including Regex
### RFC 1918 Extract
10.0.0.0 -10.255.255.255  (10/8 prefix)

172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255  (172.16/12 prefix)

192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)

### AWS Guidance

>allowed block size is between a /28 netmask and /16 netmask. In other words, the VPC can contain from 16 to 65,536 IP 
> addresses

> We recommend that you specify a CIDR block from the private (non-publicly routable) IP address ranges as specified in RFC 1918; for example, 10.0.0.0/16, or 192.168.0.0/16. It's possible to specify a range of publicly routable IP addresses; however, we currently do not support direct access to the Internet from publicly routable CIDR blocks in a VPC. Windows instances cannot boot correctly if launched into a VPC with ranges from 224.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 (Class D and Class E IP address ranges).
